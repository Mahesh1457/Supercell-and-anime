       <h2 class="display-4">Introduction</h2>
       <p style="font-size: x-large;" class = "lead" >This is not about Narcotics , It's about Games , Anime and Manga. I've played 3 supercell games , Clash of clans, Brawl Stars and Clash Royale,started playing clash of clans around 5th class, not gonna lie the game was very addictive. I was so addicted and played about 6 hours a day and then started playing clash royale and brawl stars and right now I play clash royale and brawl stars. <br>
        I used to never like reading manga but started reading Manga in 1st year of my uni. This webpage is about games , I'll also list out some websites where you can read manga for free.

       <h2 class="display-4">Clash Of Clans</h2>
       <p style="font-size: larger;" class = "lead">Clash of clans is really a fun game to play, it is about building your "base" and looting other bases , a strategy game which requires skill and timing to deploy "Troops"(Troops are the units that attack other bases) it's all fun until you get so addicted to it and lose your social life,Overall a really fun game to play.

<h2 class="display-4">Clash Royale</h2>
<p style="font-size: larger;" class = "lead">After playing clash of clans for a long time I started to played Clash Royale(CR) in 10th grade, Cr is also a strategy game and it's fun in its own way , I started Cr slow but gradually progressed overtime.
    I love how unique the game is, The artstyle of characters are very nice, I started to hate the game recently because it became pay to win i.e., you pay irl money and progress faster.<br>

<section id="brawl-stars"></section>
<h2 class="display-4">Brawl Stars</h2>
<p style="font-size: larger;">I love playing Brawl Stars(BS), Currrently at 30k trophies. Bs is a startegy game like the rest but what makes bs unqiue is you can play with almost 80+ unique brawlers(charcters to play with). Now bs brings the highest revenue for supercell and it's popularity rose from the past 4 years.
    I love brawl stars as it's a very unique and fun game to play and there are lot of events and trust me it's a skill game unless you are an Edgar player. I dont really hate bs now but some times it's annoying when there are Edgar players and yeah nothing else.
